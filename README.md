1. STL files for 3D printing of SmartCardv2 enclosure (own design). It´s a tight fit to mount, but sits really nice when done. Please note that this enclosure it designed with my Spectranet enclosure in mind, which means that it won´t directly fit a vanilla 48K och 128K machine, but that will be done in time as well.
