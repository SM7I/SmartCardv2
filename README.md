This repository contains SmartCardv2 related material. For now it has:

1. STL files for 3D printing of SmartCardv2 enclosure (own design). ItÂ´s a tight fit to mount, but sits really nice when done. Please note that this enclosure it designed with my Spectranet enclosure in mind, but it will make a perfect fit directly on 48K machines as well. The Spectranet and SmartCardv2 makes a perfect all-in-one solution, a smooth combo, that has it all.


The SmartCardv2 is designed by Phil at Retroleum and can be found here: https://www.retroleum.co.uk/spectrum-peripherals
